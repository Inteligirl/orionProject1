# Project 1 (C#)

## Project 1 Description:
Orion is one of the most famous constellations in the night sky.  In this module, you will find an image named Orion.bmp which contains a diagram of the Orion constellation.  Create a C# application that displays the Orion image in a PictureBox control.  The application should have a button that when clicked, displays the names of each of the stars.  The application should have another button that when clicked, hides the star names.  The names of the stars are Betelgeuse, Meissa, Alnitak, Alnilam, Mintaka, Saiph, and Rigel.

## My thought process

So far not having a hard time following along with the text book. Still learning my way around Visual Studio. Trying to get use to not prgramming in a command prompt! Couple of questions came to mind and occassionally I get side tracked wondering what some of the buttons do. I had to resist the urge to start changing properties in order to complete this homework. Going to go back and generate a few sample applications just to play with the settings.
